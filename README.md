Online Chair Shop
=================

Welcome to the Online Chair Shop! This web application allows you to browse and purchase chairs from the comfort of your own home. 

Features
--------

### One-Page Site

Our web application is designed as a one-page site, providing a seamless and straightforward user experience.

### Sorting by Categories

We understand that finding the perfect chair can be overwhelming with so many options. That's why we've implemented a category sorting feature. You can quickly filter chairs based on categories such as dining chairs, office chairs, folding chair. This makes it easier for you to find exactly what you're looking for.

### Add to Cart

Found a chair that caught your eye? Simply add it to your cart with a single click. Our intuitive interface allows you to easily add and remove items from your cart, giving you complete control over your shopping experience.

### Total Sum

As you add chairs to your cart, you can see the total sum updating in real time. This helps you keep track of your purchases and make informed decisions.

### Modal Window

For additional information about a specific chair, you can click on it to open a modal window. The modal provides detailed product descriptions, specifications, and any other relevant information you might need to make a confident purchase.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
